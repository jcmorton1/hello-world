# hello-world
Initial Repository
Just working through the guide.  
  What I just saw in github search "Epicor" was DMT Scripts.  I've been working in DMT and wanted to learn how to chain them together.
  That's what I'll try next after I get done with this guide.
I screwed up the first branch.  
  1 I created the readme-edits branch.
  2 Then I edited the Master readme and committed.
  3 Then I went to the readme-edits branch
    a.  edited readme and committed that back to readme-edits
    b.  Then I created the Pull Request.
So when I reviewed the Pull Request it said something like "Conflicts Exist"  and "Can't Merge"
I couldn't find my way out of that conflict so I rejected the change, and deleted the branch
Now I'm editing off of what HAS been committed to Master.
We'll see how this goes when i commit and submit a pull request
